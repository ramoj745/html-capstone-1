<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I’m Ramoj, and it's a pleasure to meet you! I’m an aspiring web developer from the Philippines, currently honing my skills and learning the ropes of web development. While I've only tackled a few introductory projects so far (which you can check out on the <a href="../index.html">Portfolio Section</a>), I'm eager to expand my experience and collaborate on new opportunities!
</p>
<p>My programming journey began with Python, where I’ve built a range of projects. These include interactive games like a command-line tic-tac-toe and blackjack, as well as a notification system for sending emails. One of my recent 'bigger' projects involved creating a weather app using the CustomTkinter library and APIs to fetch and display weather information.
</p>

<p>That's a bit about me! I hope this gives you a glimpse into my learning journey and what I'm passionate about.
